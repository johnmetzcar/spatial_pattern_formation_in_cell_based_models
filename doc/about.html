<p>Exploring spatial pattern formation in cell-based models, starting with Turing patterns in PhysiCell</p>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/johnmetzcar/spatial_pattern_formation_in_cell_based_models">repo</a> houses the code for the ENRG-E 399/599 final project for Team 1.  Team members: <a href="https://github.com/johnmetzcar">John Metzcar</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BenSDuggan">Ben Duggan</a>.  The goal of this project is to create Turing-like patterns using <a href="https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell">PhysiCell</a>.  You can download the code and run it (found in the PhysiCell directory) or run it on (NanoHub)[].</p>

<h2 id="modeldescription">Model Description</h2>

<h3 id="cellagents">Cell agents:</h3>

<p>There are 3 cells in the model: A cells, B cells and Wall cells.</p>

<ul>
<li>A cells are the inhibitor cells and are <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">blue</span>.


<ul>
<li>Using live cycle model and apoptosis</li>

<li>Motility enabled, persistance time of 5 minutes, migration bias set to 0 (completely random).</li>

<li>Secretes alpha and is effected by beta</li></ul>
</li>

<li>B cells are the effected by A cells and are <span style="color:yellow; font-weight:bold;">yellow</span>.


<ul>
<li>Using live cycle model and apoptosis</li>

<li>Motility enabled, persistance time of 5 minutes, migration bias set to 0 (completely random).</li>

<li>Secretes beta and is effected by alpha</li></ul>
</li>

<li>Wall cells are placed along the outside of the domain and prevent cells spilling outside of the domain. <span style="color:black; font-weight:bold;">black</span>.


<ul>
<li>Using live cycle model and apoptosis but both have rates set to 0 (disabeling them)</li>

<li>Motility disabled</li>

<li>Secretes and uptakes nothing</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="chemicalcomponents">Chemical components</h3>

<p>Only alpha and beta chemiclas are used in this simulation (no oxygen).  </p>

<h3 id="domain">Domain</h3>

<p>The domain is initilized to be a 500 um x 500 um with dx=dy=dz=20 um.  The simulations are designed to be run in 2D but could be converted to 3D with ease.  The domain is initiallized with wall cells along the outer perimiter.  The A and B cells are initilized in a couple user defined ways using the <i>placement_pattern</i> XML paramater.  If set to 1 the domain will be competely filled.  If set to 2 it will simulate a sparcer domain that were used to run the simulations.  Anything greater than 2 will make the domain even spacer.  Additionally, <i>placement_pattern</i> can be set to -1 to simulate a few strips that give an interesting pattern and -2 for the same strips but with the cells in the middle half gone. </p>
