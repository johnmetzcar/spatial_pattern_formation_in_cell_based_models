% Date: \today
\\
1. Goals for the prior week: 
\\
Produce a working simulation that captures or is capable of capturing
specifications as outlined in the  CBM Turing pattern specification.
\\
\\
\\
2. Progress towards last week's goals:
\\
Accomplished above goal.
\\
\\
\\
3. Obstacles or surprises:
\\
Navigating custom cell function specification versus accessing premade cell cycle functions.
\\
Separate code development leading to temporary misunderstandings.
\\
\\
4. Potential solutions to obstacles:
\\
Experience with PC.

More careful reading of the code.
\\
\\
\\
5. Next week's goals:
\\
Tweak model parameters of functions, such as rates of inhibition, apoptosis, motility and proliferation, to produce spotted Turing like pattern.
\\
\\
\\
6. Any necessary changes in project definition:
\\
Could also have $\alpha$ and $\beta$ fields change motility (speed), proliferation or all three instead of just apoptotic rate.
