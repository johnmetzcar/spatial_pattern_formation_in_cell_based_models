\maketitle

\section{Objects}

\begin{outline}
\1 Cell types
\2 Cell A - blue
\3 Parameter - $\alpha$ secretion rate
\2 Cell B - yellow
\3 Parameter - $\beta$ secretion rate

\2 Additional properties
\3 Growth rates
\3 Death rates
\3 Motility rates

\1 Diffusing chemical signals
\2 2 Density - signalling chemicals
\3 Parameter - Diffusion coefficient
\3 Parameter - Decay rate

\end{outline}

\section{Behaviors}

\begin{outline}

\1 Switching behavior - Potential implemented later (stretch goal)
\2 Chemical basis
\2 Contact basis 

\1 Proliferation - $P_a < P_b$
\1 Death - $D_b \propto C_{\alpha}$, specifically apoptotic death rate
\1 Motility - unequal $M_a > M_b$

\end{outline}

\section{Initial and boundary conditions}

\begin{outline}

\1 Initial conditions
\2 Cells

\3 Random initialization (primary work)
\3 Full field of cells/circle of cells (secondary)
\3 Work towards growing from a single cell (secondary - and this might need a different underlying model - like one that uses prepatterning or different cell interactions)

\2 Chemical fields
\3 No Dirichlet conditions
\3 Morphogens
\4 Uniform 0.0 value field

\1 Boundary Conditions
\2 von Neuman

\end{outline}

\section{Dynamics}

\begin{outline}
 
 \1 Goal (primary): Form Turing like pattern of stripes and dots using density signaling chemical and two randomly motile cell types.
 
 \2 Do we need to limit proliferation some how? 
 \2 Do we need to limit motility (like we could decrease motility in the presence of the signal or increase adhesion)? 
 \2 Can we limit this being temporally stable?
 
\1 Goal (tertiary): Oscillatory steady-state (can we do this with our model?? probably not)
\2 Perhaps like a the BZ reaction - are they related enough?

\1 Goal (tertiary): Turning pattern from initial growing cells - spontaneous and dynamic pattern generation

\1 Goal (tertiary): Explore formation of a Turing pattern using contact signaling only or in combination with a morphogen
\2 Compare with chemical morphogenesis patterns and parameters

\1 Goal (tertiary - different model that would use phenotyp switching): Form Turing like pattern from initial static and non-``differentiated cells" using chemical morphogens
\2 Parameter exploration to the extent that typical behaviors are seen, whatever those are (need to read paper)
\2 Expected changes with domain size

\end{outline}
